# Define internal network interfaces and if needed, corresponding network
# addresses.  Normally network addresses are discovered via Netlink but for
# cases where Netlink is unavailable or when capturing from a mirrored port,
# they should be specified as a comma-delimited list as shown below:
# NETIFYD_INTNET="eth1 eth2 eth3,192.168.0.0/24,10.0.0.0/16"

# Define external network interfaces.  For PPPoE interfaces, you can optionally
# specify the associated physical ethernet interface to set the MAC address.
# NETIFYD_EXTNET="eth4 ppp0,eth5"
